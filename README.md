# Auto-Updating Altstore Source for [ApolloPatcher â†—](https://github.com/ichitaso/ApolloPatcher)

I've made an auto-updating [Altstore source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Balackburn/Apollo/main/apps.json) for [**ApolloPatcher**](https://github.com/ichitaso/ApolloPatcher). It checks daily for new releases and updates the source with the latest version, ensuring you always have access to the most recent updates.

## [Website for ApolloPatcher Altstore Source](https://balackburn.github.io/Apollo/)

Additionally, I've created a [website](https://balackburn.github.io/Apollo/) for it (just edited the one I made for YTLitePlus).

> I hope you'll find it both useful and visually appealing.

## Why?

I really love Apollo and hope it will help some people to keep using it instead of the official app.
