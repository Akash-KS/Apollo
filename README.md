# Altstore Source for Apollo

I've called this repo only "Apollo", for a better presentation on my Github Page site.

This is an auto-updating Altstore [source](https://balackburn.github.io/Apollo/apps.json) for **Artemis for Apollo**. It checks daily for new releases and updates the source with the latest version, ensuring you always have access to the most recent updates.

# Website 

Additionally, there is a [website](https://balackburn.github.io/Apollo/) for it (just edited the one I made for YTLitePlus).

I hope you'll find it both useful and visually appealing.

# Why?

I really love Apollo and hope it will help some people to keep using it instead of the official app.
